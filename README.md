## Quiere Que le Baile?

Web-based application that allows users to learn and practice dance steps. The platform provides a user-friendly interface to explore different dance steps, and practice them. This is part of a coding challenge to be part of [Makers](https://www.makers.build "Makers") _Coding Fellowship_

## How to Run

To run the Dance Steps Learning Platform locally, follow these steps:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies used

`Next.js`: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications, used Next API as well.
`Tailwind CSS`: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
Vercel: A cloud platform for deploying Next.js applications.
`PostgreSQL`: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
`Prisma`: A database toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for Node.js.
`SWR`: A React hook library for data fetching and synchronization.

##Future Ideas

Here are some possible future ideas to enhance the Dance Steps Learning Platform:

- Recording and ranking: Implement the ability for users to record their dance steps and receive rankings or feedback.
- Expanded dance step library: Provide a wider range of music genres and dance steps for users to explore and practice.
- Social networking features: Enable users to upload and share their dance steps in a social network-like environment, fostering connections and collaboration among dance enthusiasts.

Please note that these ideas are not implemented in the current version of the project.
